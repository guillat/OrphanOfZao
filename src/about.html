                    he Orphan of Zhao is a Chinese play from the Yuan era, attributed to the
                    13th-century dramatist Ji Junxiang (紀君祥). The play has as its full name The
                    Great Revenge of the Orphan of Zhao. The play is classified in the zaju genre of
                    dramas.[3] It revolves around the central theme of revenge.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The play is divided in six parts, comprising five acts (折 zhe) and a wedge
                    (楔子 xiezi), which may be an interlude or—as it is in this case—a prologue.[4]
                    It contains both dialogue and songs.[4] The story of The Orphan of Zhao takes
                    place during the Spring and Autumn period.[5] The protagonists are General Han
                    Jue in the first act, the retired Minister Gongsun Chujiu (公孙杵臼) in the
                    second and third act, and the Zhao orphan in the final two acts.[4] The Orphan
                    of Zhao was the earliest Chinese play to be known in Europe.[6]

                <p class="text">
                    Until Ji Junxiang's play in the 13th century, the story appeared in prose form
                    as historical narrative. After Ji's play, stage drama was the main form, with
                    numerous regional operas, some completely independent of his play.[7] The
                    Records of the Grand Historian, written by the historian Sima Qian from the Han
                    dynasty, contains a chapter surrounding the events of the Zhao family.[8] These
                    records were adapted by Ji Junxiang in The Orphan of Zhao.[9]
